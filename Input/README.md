# Command line input

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of command line input. If you are new to using the terminal, passing input to a program might be unfamiliar to you. Let's take a look at how.

Suppose we have a simple program called `app.js`. This program prints out whatever you pass to it. You can pass it arguments by simply writing them after the programâ€™s name in the terminal. Try it out with the command `node app.js Hello`. Hit the RUN button to get started.

```javascript
console.log('Hey there,' , process.argv[2]);
```

The process module and, specifically, process.argv is what we want to focus on right now. You might be wondering why we have a 2 in square brackets after argv. This is because all of our command-line arguments are passed to the argv property.

- The first argument, `0`, is the `process.execPath`, which is the path of the Node.js executable.
- The second argument, `1`, is the path of the JavaScript file being run.
- The next argument(s) are the command-line arguments, if any have been passed. In our case, this will be a simple `Hello`.

Uncomment the code on line 2 to line 4 to see the indices used.
